# GoogleMaps-Project

echo "# GoogleMaps-Project" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/zswingle/GoogleMaps-Project.git
git push -u origin master


The Addition I made was I made the map look bigger, and changed the zoom on the map.
